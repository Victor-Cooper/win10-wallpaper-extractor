The python file is the program
You can change the file locations in case of your win10 stores the files in a different folder 
or you want the produced files to be stored somewhere else
----------

The reason why I turn the python program into an exe file is that I want to invoke it like a
built in DOS command.
The steps to take to turn a python progame into an exe file (assuming you have installed python already):
 1. pip install pyinstaller
 2. install pywin32: https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases (you can try step 3 first, if it works you can skip step2)
 3. pyinstaller -F {your_program_location} (the exe file locates in the dist folder in DOS current working directory)
